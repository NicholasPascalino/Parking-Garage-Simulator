# Parking-Garage-Simulator
This Program utilizes linked lists and stacks to simulate the operation of two Parking Garages, working in conjunction with each other. If one of the parking garages is full, then the incoming remaining cars requesting will be put in the second garage. If both garages are full, then the cars will be denied access to the garages and put onto the street. If a pickup is requested, then the garages will be scanned forvia the linked lists representing the garages. The cars blocking the car requested within the garage are temporarily moved to the street, and moved back into the garage upon removal of the car requested. Cars can request entry or pickup, depending on the information in the .txt file. To run this program, xcode is the preferred compiler. However, Visual Studios is a compatible IDE, but may require different libraries.
